This is a program to manipulate Demographia data on the urban areas of the
world.  The (not always totally clean..) data is supposed to have all of them
in the world with >= 500k people, and for certain countries has additional data
(e.g. all the way down to >= 5k in AU).

The data here is from the 2012-07 edition.

For "urban area" vs "metro area":

The data seems to only be published as a PDF so there was various hackery to do
to get it into a form which is easy to process.
